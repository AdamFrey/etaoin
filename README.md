Pure Clojure implementation of [Webdriver][url-webdriver] protocol.

Use that library to automate a browser, test your frontend behaviour, simulate
human actions or whatever you want.

It's named after [Etaoin Shrdlu][url-wiki] -- a typing machine that became alive
after a mysteries note was produced on it.

## Benefits

- Selenium-free: no long dependencies, no tons of downloaded jars, etc.
- Lightweight, fast. Simple, easy to understand.
- Compact: just one main module with a couple of helpers.
- Declarative: the code is just a list of actions.

## Capabilities

- Currently supports Chrome, Firefox, Phantom.js and Safari (partially).
- May either connect to a remote driver or run it on your local machine.
- Run your unit tests directly from Emacs pressing `C-t t` as usual.
- Can imitate human-like behaviour (delays, typos, etc).
